I manged to create the code thanks to chatgpt,
since it was a small code there were no problems,
except in the output file, that was because i forgot
to print out the content to a file instead i was trying 
to print it to the folder instead

The Purpose of the code is to read the leases my dhcp has leased
and saves the output to a html file.
